## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-planner
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`** - Start development server with hot reload
- **`npm run build`** - Build for production (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- **`npm run preview`** - Preview production build locally
- **`npm run lint`** - Run ESLint for code quality checks

## Configuration

### Backend API
The application is configured to proxy API requests to a backend server at `http://localhost:8080`. Update the proxy settings in `vite.config.ts` if your backend runs on a different port.

```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
  },
}
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment-specific configuration (if needed).
